[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/630b6b92-b0a9-4a4c-b49c-fa17dfc8e796/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/jovial-bardeen-98b8a3/deploys)

## Requirements & Setup
You need to have **node.js** installed. 

Start with `npm run init`

This command will init a git repository on your machine, install dependencies and remove useless files and directories for your project.
After that, this command won't be available anymore.

## Development
Run the local webpack-dev-server with hotreload and autocompile on:
- local: [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)
- network: http://your-local-ip:8080/

```sh
$ npm run dev
```

### Debug
Go to your-url/#debug

## Deployment
Build the current application (default output in `dist/`).
```sh
$ npm run build
```
